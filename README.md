## Presentation

"Python Island" is a console game. You are a lost surivor after your boat sunk. Your goal is to complete 3 quest in order to leave this island:

- [Guess the number](#guess-the-number)
- [Ceasar Code](#ceasar-code)
- [FizzBuzz](#fizzbuzz)

You need to take care of your energy, thirst and food, otherwise you could die. You also have an inventory, in wich you can store food, water bottles or artifacts to help you during your quests.

## Prerequisite

In order for this game to works, and have the best graphical experience you must install the new windows terminal. Indeed, this game use emojis to display the player, palm trees, quests... You don't _need_ to install this console, but if you don't you'll just have squares in place of emojis.

To install the new windows terminal, go to the `windows store` and type `terminal` in the search box. You'll then see the new Windows terminal.

## Quests

There are 3 different quest. Each quest give a special key, necessary to leave the island.

### Guess the number

This game is pretty simple. All you have to do is to guess a number between 0 and 100 three times. You have 20 try to guess the three numbers. Once it's done, you'll get the bronze key.

There is nothing fancy to say about this game.

### Ceasar Code

In this game, you'll have to decode a secret message. This will give you the silver key.

### Fizzbuzz

The last quest is random game. In fact, you dont have to do anything, just let the game play for you. You are against a certain number of monkeys and their boss. The goal is to enumerate numbers, starting from 1, and to **fizz** when the number is a multiple of 3, **buzz** if it's a multiple of 5, and **fizzbuzz** if it's both. Otherwise, you just say the number.

## The map and graphical element

All the elements related to the map / animations are in the map folder.

## Mods

The most important point of this game is to be "modable". You have a _mod_ folder in wich you can store moded json file. If you want to do it, you **need** to respect the exact same syntax as the main json file stored in the _data_ folder.

### To create new quests

If you want to add a new quest, you first need to add its coordinate in a _coordinates.json_ file into the _mods_ folder. You must copy the _coordinates.json_ file in order to add your own coords among the original one. Moreover, you need to specify :

- what kind of mark should your quest be shown as
- what's the name of the folder in wich your file is
- what's the name of the file wich launch the quest

You **need** to have a _main_ function into the main file. You can also use the _checkLength_ function to create your very own story. To achieve this you can copy the _cinematic.json_ file and add your own story. You **need** to give the same name for the cinematic key and your main file.

## Functions

This folder contain all the functions used throughout the game.

- [checkLength](#checkLength)
- [checkMod](#checkMod)

### checkLength

This function takes *one parameter* : the name of the file wich runs it.

*It returns a list* of all the sentences.

Its use is to get the story / dialog associated to this game. In order for this function to work, you must **set the same name** for the main file wich run the function as well as in the json wich store all the stories.

### checkMod

This function takes *one parameter* : the name of the json file we want to read.

*It returns the json* as a list or a dict.

Its use is to get the json file required, but check first if this file already existed as a mod. In order for this function to work, you must set **the same name** for your moded json file as the original one. You also must **copy the original one**, or all the basic data won't be red.

This game is pretty simple. All you have to do is to guess a number between 0 and 100 three times. You have 20 try to guess the three numbers. Once it's done, you'll get the bronze key.

### Ceasar Code

In this game, you'll have to decode a secret message. This will give you the silver key.

### Fizzbuzz

The last quest is random game. In fact, you dont have to do anything, just let the game play for you. You are against a certain number of monkeys and their boss. The goal is to enumerate numbers, starting from 1, and to **fizz** when the number is a multiple of 3, **buzz** if it's a multiple of 5, and **fizzbuzz** if it's both. Otherwise, you just say the number.
